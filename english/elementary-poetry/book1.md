## 画 A Painting
远看山有色 From distance,mountain is richly colorful  
近听水无声 At close-up,flowing water does not make a sound  
春去花还在 Spring is gone,but flowers are still around  
人来鸟不惊 People come near,but birds do not seem frightened  


## 四季 four seasons
草芽尖尖,                   The grass-shoot is pointed at the tip,
他对小鸟说:"我是春天".      he says to a little bird,"I am spring".
荷叶圆圆,                   A lotus leaf is round in shape.
他对青蛙说:"我是夏天".      he says to a frog,"i am summer".
谷穗弯弯,                   An ear of paddy rice is curved in poise.
他鞠着躬说:"我是秋天".      he bows and says,"i am autumn".
雪人大肚子一挺,             A snowman sticks out his big tummy,
他顽皮的说:"我是冬天".      he says naughtily,"i am winter".
